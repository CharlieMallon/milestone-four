# Cake Shop

### Milestone Four

Over the last year or so, Jane has changed a hobby into a growing business. In order to stay competitive and viable, new markets need to be opened, the largest market she can tap into is online shopping. Therefore the next logical step is an e-commerce site. As well as providing sales a full-stack site can give her a greater understanding of her client base and the products that they buy.

<!-- ![mockUp](readme-docs/mockup.jpg) -->

## User Experience (UX)

The aim is to build a user-friendly e-commerce store. It will be based around browsing, selecting and buying products.

Users should be able to view products in a collection or as an individual product. They should be able to search the product base for a particular product or keyword. Items should be easily added and removed from the shopping basket. Users should be able to checkout with ease. Users with a account should be able to see their pervious orders, order status and edit any personal information.

An Admin users should be able to add, edit and remove both products and images conveniently from the frontend. They should be able to edit and update orders status and information.

## Design Considerations and General Comments
### Buy button location
The 'checkout' button is at the top of the screen with a summary of how much it will cost to encourage users to checkout early, eventually this will 'stick' to the top of the page so it is always accessible to the user.
### Webhooks
I have left webhooks until Issue two as I can see the power of them but feel that I need to do some more research before implementing them.
### Refactoring
I have done limited re-factoring on this project, I would have liked to split the css file into multiple files however have been focusing more on adding functionality.
### Wireframes
I have fully embraced the mobile first philosophy, this means I have detailed mobile wireframes but no tablet or desktop wireframes.  It was a continuous decision to do mobile wireframes in great detail, as more users are on mobile devices and i wanted the Shop Owners to be able to do things when they had a moment rather than having to set time aside when they are on a computer.
### Secret Key in Github Repo
This was done in error, the Secret key is question was changed and moved to the env.py before full deployment.
### Error Pages and Security
I had hoped to include custom error pages for 404, 500 and 403 errors. Alas time got away with me (as it often does). I planned to have the header and footer displayed on the error page allowing the user to easily navigate to where they need to be.  until i have created theses pages however I have ensured that most Errors display to the user in the message bar. I believe I have covered most of the big security issues however would be very interested to know if you find any!
### Comments
There are a greater than average comments in this code, this is because it is still quite a work in progress, I would usually try to remove more of these comments however I have run out of time.
## Features
I have split the features into Beta, Issue 1, Issue 2 & Issue 3. The project is currently at the Issue one.

## Validators
### HTML Validator
### CSS Validator

### PEP8
Passed - some comments about line being a little too long, changed where possible.
### Testing Summary
Site looks it best on Mobile, App is fairly well secured.  Removing the Contact Page as there is No time to fix before deployment, issue is due to trying to set up emails. One or two bugs picked up and fixed during texting see bug section for more information. Note - this code has not been through a validator.
### Interesting Bugs / Issues
This section will detail the interesting Issues and Bugs that I came across whilst coding and the main ones that I found during testing.

**During coding**

| Issue/Bug | Comments | Final Fix |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| image not fully deleting | When a product is deleted the image is left in the database, this could cause storage and coding issues in the future. Whilst this is not a 'bug' to ensure the expandability of the site I have excluded it here. | Installed django cleanup. deletes the image completely from the database. https://pypi.org/project/django-cleanup/0.1.9/ |
|You can checkout with less than 6 cakes|I found that by changing the link to checkout in the address bar I could checkout with less than 6 cakes, which is the minimum order quantity.| Added an if statement to the check view to enure that this can no longer be done|
| Real Emails not sending | I have tried two different companies to send real emails and looked at using an API to send emails. However I cannot seem to get it to work! For now I have turned off the Confirmation Email for the log on to allow users to use the site. Emails are logging fine to the console more investigation is required.| To be found - temporarily turned off email confirmation required.
| Date picker wasn't showing | This is a 'expected' error but was causing issues when submitting the form | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60389224/datetimeinput-is-being-rendered-as-simple-text-input-in-django

**During Testing**

| Issue/Bug | Comments | Final Fix |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Basket page not loading on server | I works on my local drive, seems to be an issue with the quantity-form includes. Routing is stringent on heroku the / is a \! |change the \ for a / |
| Checkout next buttons just reloading the page| I had not added the js to do this. js added and now works| added the code to make it work|
|Contact Page has catastrophic error with the table or model| Due to time constraints i don't have tie to fix this so i have removed the page, it is likely to do with the emails i tried to set up as i was setting them up in the contact section| remove link to the page temporarily|

4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

8. Once this has been completed use the following command to install all the packages required.
