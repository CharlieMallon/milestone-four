# Cake Shop

### Milestone Four

Over the last year or so, Jane has changed a hobby into a growing business. In order to stay competitive and viable, new markets need to be opened, the largest market she can tap into is online shopping. Therefore the next logical step is an e-commerce site. As well as providing sales a full-stack site can give her a greater understanding of her client base and the products that they buy.

## Testing
Full Testing is detailed in a separate file [here](testing.md).
### Interesting Bugs / Issues
This section will detail the interesting Issues and Bugs that I came across whilst coding and the main ones that I found during testing.

**During coding**

| Issue/Bug | Comments | Final Fix |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| image not fully deleting | When a product is deleted the image is left in the database, this could cause storage and coding issues in the future | Installed django cleanup. deletes the image completely from the database. https://pypi.org/project/django-cleanup/0.1.9/ |

**During Testing**

| Issue/Bug | Comments | Final Fix |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
|           |          |           |

## Deployment
### Project Creation
I used VScode and git to produce this project.
The following commands were used to keep version control
-   `git add .` to stage files before committing
-   `git commit -m "message explaining commit"` to commit the local repository
-   `git push` to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
### Deployment to Heroku

**Create application:**

1. Navigate to Heroku.com and login or sign up.
2. Click on the new button.
3. Select create new app.
4. Enter the app name, this must be unique.
5. Select region.
6. Click Create App.

**Set up connection to Github Repository:**

1. Click the deploy tab
2. Select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. A prompt to find a github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
4. Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
5. Once the repo has been found, click the connect button.
6. To enable automatic deployment (_optional_)
    1. Scroll to the Automatic deploys section
    2. Choose the branch you want to deploy from
    3. Click Enable Automation Deploys.

**Set environment variables:**

1. Click on the settings tab
2. Click the 'reveal config vars' button.
3. Variables needed:
    - IP
    - MONGO_DBNAME
    - MONGO_URI
    - PORT
    - SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

_These variables change depending on your set up so I will not add mine here._

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CharlieMallon/milestoneTwo)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

8. Once this has been completed use the following command to install all the packages required.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

Secret key - moved to the env.py before deployment.

Cantelo Treats

facebook - https://www.facebook.com/cantelotreats/?ref=page_internal

## Minimum Requirements

-   Allows users to store and manipulate data records
-   The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps
-   Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course (changing the field names of the miniproject models is not customisation)
-   User can register, log in (and has a reason to do so) - stretch also can DELETE account
-   Shop owner has crud abilities
-   Use stripe for payments
-   Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout
-   The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience
-   Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users
-   Use gitHub for version control
-   Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README
-   Deploy to Heroku.
-   Ensure site is secure.

## Project Idea

Build a site to sell pretty cakes for Cantelo Treats

### External userâs goal:

-   Buy cakes to celebrate.

### Site owner's goal:

-   Sell cakes in their local area

### Potential features to include:

-   Showcase previous work
-   Browse current available products
-   The site owner, logging in as a special user, can add/remove products and images

### Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have):

-   The site owner can view and access their upcoming orders.
-   Messaging between site user and customer is done using facebook or emails (depending on user preference)
-   messaging on site between Customer and Shop owner
